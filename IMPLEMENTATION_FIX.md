# RHOAI Security Manifest Implementation Fix

## Issue Summary
The original implementation was incorrectly attempting to use the Red Hat Security Data API (access.redhat.com/hydra/rest/security) by directly querying for container names. The correct workflow requires:
1. First obtaining container image details and manifest data with RPM packages
2. Then querying security/vulnerability data for each individual package

## Changes Implemented

### 1. New Data Models (security_data.py)
- Added `RPMPackage` class to represent individual RPM packages
- Added `ContainerManifest` class to hold container image manifests with packages
- Updated `ContainerSecurityInfo` to include package-level vulnerability data

### 2. Container Catalog Client Updates (container_catalog.py)
- Added `get_image_by_id()` method for fetching image details
- Added `get_rpm_manifest()` method for retrieving RPM package lists
- Added `get_image_vulnerabilities()` method for direct vulnerability queries
- Implemented fallback mechanisms for missing API endpoints

### 3. Security Data Client Updates (security_data.py)
- Replaced container-based queries with `get_package_vulnerabilities()` method
- Added `analyze_container_packages()` method that analyzes all packages in a manifest
- Updated to query vulnerabilities by package name/version instead of container name
- Added demo data for testing while actual APIs are being developed

### 4. Orchestrator Workflow Updates (orchestrator.py)
- Updated `_analyze_container_security()` to use the new package-based approach:
  1. Fetch container image details
  2. Get RPM manifest for each container
  3. Analyze security for each package in the manifest
  4. Aggregate results by container

### 5. Demo Mode
Since the Red Hat Container Catalog API endpoints for RPM manifests are not yet available, the implementation includes:
- Demo RPM package data for common container types (notebooks, tensorflow, pytorch)
- Simulated vulnerability data for testing the workflow
- Graceful fallback when APIs return 404 errors

## Correct API Workflow

```python
# Step 1: Discover containers (existing functionality)
containers = await catalog_client.discover_rhoai_containers(release_version)

# Step 2: For each container, get its manifest
for container in containers:
    # Get image details
    image_details = await catalog_client.get_image_by_id(container.id)
    
    # Get RPM manifest
    rpm_manifest = await catalog_client.get_rpm_manifest(image_details['_id'])
    
    # Step 3: Analyze packages for vulnerabilities
    security_info = await security_client.analyze_container_packages(rpm_manifest)
```

## Benefits of the New Approach

1. **Accurate Vulnerability Mapping**: Vulnerabilities are correctly mapped to specific package versions
2. **Package-Level Granularity**: Can identify exactly which packages have vulnerabilities
3. **Better API Alignment**: Follows Red Hat's documented security scanning workflow
4. **Scalable**: Can analyze containers with hundreds of packages efficiently

## Future Improvements

When the Red Hat Container Catalog API fully supports the required endpoints:
1. Remove demo data and use actual API responses
2. Implement caching for RPM manifests to reduce API calls
3. Add support for OVAL data matching for more accurate vulnerability assessment
4. Integrate with Pyxis API for additional container metadata

## Testing

The implementation has been tested with:
- Manual container configuration for RHOAI 2.19.0
- Simulated RPM package data
- Demo vulnerability data for common packages

To run with real data once APIs are available:
```bash
make run ARGS="generate --release 2.19.0"
```

## Conclusion

The implementation now correctly follows the intended workflow of:
1. Container Discovery → 2. Package Manifest Retrieval → 3. Package Vulnerability Analysis

This approach will provide accurate security assessments once the required API endpoints are available.
