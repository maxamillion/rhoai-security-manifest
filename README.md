RHOAI Security Manifest
=======================

A simple script to produce a security manifest for [Red Hat OpenShift AI](https://www.redhat.com/en/products/ai/openshift-ai).

You will need to [login to Red Hat's Container Registry](https://access.redhat.com/articles/RegistryAuthentication) where the Product Images are stored.

This is meant to be executed from a Linux system running [podman](https://podman.io/).
