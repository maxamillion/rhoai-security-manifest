# RHOAI Security Dashboard

A React-based security dashboard for Red Hat OpenShift AI (RHOAI) that displays comprehensive security analysis of container images using data from the RHOAI Security Pyxis tool.

## Features

- **Security Overview**: Summary cards showing total images, CVEs, security grades, and most vulnerable components
- **Visual Analytics**: Interactive charts displaying security grade distribution and vulnerability analysis
- **Detailed Table**: Sortable, filterable table of all container images with expandable CVE details
- **CVE Management**: Searchable list of all unique vulnerabilities with direct links to Red Hat advisories
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface using PatternFly design system

## Technology Stack

- **React 18** with hooks
- **PatternFly 5** for UI components and design system
- **Victory Charts** for data visualization
- **Vite** for fast development and building

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+ and npm
- Python 3.x (for generating security data)

### Installation

1. Navigate to the dashboard directory:
   ```bash
   cd rhoai-security-dashboard
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Generate sample data (from parent directory):
   ```bash
   cd ..
   python3 rhoai_security_pyxis.py --release v2.21 --format json --output rhoai-security-dashboard/public/sample_data.json
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   cd rhoai-security-dashboard
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Open your browser to http://localhost:5173

## Data Source

The dashboard consumes JSON data generated by the `rhoai_security_pyxis.py` script. The expected data structure includes:

- `metadata`: Release information, totals, and generation timestamp
- `images`: Array of container image data with CVEs, security grades, and advisory links
- `unique_cves`: Deduplicated list of all CVEs found across images

## Components

### SecuritySummary
Overview cards displaying key security metrics with color-coded severity indicators.

### SecurityCharts
Visual representations including:
- Donut chart for security grade distribution
- Horizontal bar chart for most vulnerable images

### ImageTable
Interactive table featuring:
- Sortable columns (name, grade, CVE count, date)
- Grade-based filtering
- Expandable rows with detailed CVE information
- Pagination for large datasets

### CVEList
Comprehensive CVE management with:
- Search functionality
- Direct links to Red Hat security advisories
- Pagination for easy navigation

## Responsive Design

The dashboard is optimized for various screen sizes:
- **Desktop**: Full multi-column layout with side-by-side charts
- **Tablet**: Stacked layout with responsive grid adjustments
- **Mobile**: Single-column layout with touch-friendly controls

## Color Coding

Security grades follow a consistent color scheme:
- **A**: Green (excellent security)
- **B**: Gold (good security)
- **C**: Orange (acceptable security)
- **D/F**: Red (poor security)

CVE counts use similar color coding based on severity thresholds.

## Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

The built files will be in the `dist/` directory, ready for deployment to any web server.

## Integration

To integrate with live data:

1. Set up an API endpoint that serves the JSON data in the expected format
2. Update the data fetch URL in `src/App.jsx`
3. Add error handling and loading states as needed
4. Consider implementing real-time updates for continuous monitoring
